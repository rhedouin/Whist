This toolbox is used to 
create WM Models (1)
simulate the corresponding ME-GRE (2)
create a dictionary from these signals (3)
train a deep learning with the dictionary (4)

post-process data (5)
recover brain parameter maps (6)


(1) functions in createWMModel 
see createOneWMModelExample.m
Easy to parallelize if a large number of WM models are needed

(2) functions in signalSimulations
simulate the ME-GRE signal for one WM model
see simulateFieldPerturbationExample.m 

(3) functions in signalSimulations
simulate the ME-GRE signal for many WM models and microstructure parameters range
everything is parallelized
createDictionaryCompletePipeline.m directly creates the dictionary from the WM models following several steps:
computeCompartmentSignalFromModels creates the field perturbation and the corresponding ME-GRE signals for different WM models parameters (FVF, g-ratio) for each compartment (intra-axonal, extra-axonal, myelin) 
computeTotalSignalDictionaryPart creates the total signal adding the T2 weighting, the compartment weights and normalize the signal
concatenateDictionaryParts concatenates the previous results into an entire dictionary

(4) function in deep_learning
Keras_train_WMModel_BS3_all_orientations_with_regularization_new_scaling.py within deep_learning
To be used on a GPU, just need to fill the dictionary details

(5) functions in exVivoProcessing
see transformAndConcatenateBS3DataMain.m (parallalized along flip angles)
Processed the data from acquisition, take the magn and unwrapped phase all registered in the same space (same rotations should be used than with the dictionary) and transform it into a ME-GRE signal normalized concatenate along all orientations and include the theta fiber orientation.

(6) function in deep_learning
recover_parameter_BS3_all_orientations_polyfit_cartesian_new_scaling.py
To be used on GPU, create brain parameter maps from the trained deep learning (4) and the concatenate signals (5)
